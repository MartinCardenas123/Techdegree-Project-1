        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I was born in San Francisco California and was raised there for multiple years, when I was about 8 years old I ended up moving to Oakland and have been living here since. I have a pretty big family and a lot of support from people around me who care for me a lot and I enjoy everything that I do.</p>
        <p>I have enjoyed playing football my whole life, I have grown around a family that loves football and I love the 49ers I've been to their games since I was a baby and I love watching them play and I'm a super fan.</p>
